PART 1a: Relational Databases
Sources: Socratica (YouTube), others


# Database
 * An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
 * Usually controlled by a database management system.

# Relational Database
 - A collection of tables.
 - Each table contains a define set of columns and rows to contain the data.
 - Each row is called a *record*.
 - Each table can be related to another table.
 - The collection of tables in a database is called a *schema*.
 - A *primary key* is a value that uniquely identifies each record in a specific table.

## Commercial
 * Paid software or service.
 * Includes: Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft  
     
## Open-Source
 * Manage by a community, 
 * Publicly available, and is 
 * Open for public use, with varying terms and conditions.
 * Licenses differs, but is usually permissive.
 * Example includes: MySQL/i, MariaDB (MySQLi), PostgreSQL, SQLite 
 
## X/LAMPP
 * X-CrossPlatform/L-inux, A-pache, M-ySQL, P-HP, P-Perl
 * Offers MySQL, now MariaDB, as DBMS.
 * Can be installed locally or configured in a server or vitual machine.
 
## Data and Simultaneous Access
 * Small Data/Limited Users: Locally-stored Database for control and fixed costs. 
 * Large Data/Simultaneous Access: Cloud Computing. 
 
## Local and Open-source 
 * Customizable, but requirements are limited to hardware and software availability.
 * May cost less in money in short-term.
 * Cost more in time (latency) 
 
## Cloud Services
 * Marketed as **X as a Service** (`XaaS`).
 * Allows both proprietary and open-source databases.
 * Higher requirements normally mean higher costs.
 * Requirements: Data Center, server type, and backup (among other services).
 * Other cloud services: Data/file storage, Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. 
 * Use of data: Train Classifiers (ML), Build ML Models, Image Recognition, or Speech Recognition
 * Depending on the plan or package:
     - Automatic adjustments to the spike of simultaneous usage.
     - Horizontal Scaling: Add more servers to handle the load.
 * Money vs Time:
     - Cost more in money 
     - Cost less in time (global access, speed)
 * Choice for companies with a sizeable budget.
 
## Migration 
 * Migration of local, open-source databases to a cloud service is straightforward
 * There are tools available to streamline the migration process.
 
## MySQL/i vs MariaDB vs PostgreSQL 
 * Difference: Not much on core features 
 * Ownership: MySQL/i is owned by Oracle (through Sun Microsystems) and development is mostly inactive.
 * Open-source DBMSs are actively improved by its community of developers and users.
 * Some performace claims.
 * Other unique features.
 
## Transferable Skills 
 > While experience is mostly required, database management skills are mostly transferrable.
 1. SQL 
 2. Schema Design 
 3. Database Optimization
